In this example, we will get the `Activity Count` where the `Proposition` is "Root" and the `Activity Type` is "AT 1". This shows us how to get the `Activity Count` for any case where we are exactly specifying the `Proposition` and the `Activity Type`.

As there is no aggrigation needed, we first open the `DIP`, select the field we want, and apply our filters:

![example-activity-count-specific-1]

We can now save our rule as this is all we need to do at this step.

![example-activity-count-specific-2]


Now we have this rule, we can use it our future rules where we want to check the value of this `Activity Count`.
